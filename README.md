## Project Overview

The Mini Real Estate Floor Selector is a prototype for a real estate application where users can:

- Browse three towers (e.g., Tower A, B, C).
- Select a floor from a list of 10–15 floors.
- View 3–4 apartment layouts per floor with thumbnail images and metadata (area, unit type, room count,Bathrooms).
- See a detailed view of a selected apartment layout.
- Experience a smooth hover/tap interaction for apartment thumbnails.

The project is built with React and uses dummy data for towers, floors, and apartments. It’s designed to be responsive and user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

- **Tower Overview**: Displays three clickable tower cards (Tower A, B, C).
- **Floor Selection**: Lists 10–15 floors for the selected tower, with clickable floor cards.
- **Apartment Layouts**: Shows 3–4 apartment layouts per floor, each with:
  - Thumbnail image (placeholder).
  - Metadata: area (e.g., 800 sq ft), unit type (e.g., 2BHK), room count (e.g., 2 bedrooms).
- **Detailed Layout View**: Displays a larger image and full metadata for a selected apartment.
- **Navigation**: Smooth navigation between views with a back button.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Bonus Interaction**: Hovering (or tapping on mobile) over an apartment thumbnail scales it up slightly and darkens the background with a smooth animation.
